A simple educational application based on the MVC architectural pattern.
The unit of the model is based on the characters of the online game Dota 2. A tabular representation of all the characters.

At the top of the screen, above the table, there is a SearchBar that allows you to find a hero by name.

In addition, the user can sort heroes by their type (in total, 3 types of heroes are defined in the game, according to their main attribute: strength, dexterity or intelligence). 
Moreover, you can sort by type both all the heroes and those who were previously selected by name.
